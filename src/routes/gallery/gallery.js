                Edwin is the brother of Keye Luke, the actor you may recognize from the Kung Fu series and many other productions.  Edwin was an actor as well as Social Worker.
                In this (1954?) photo, the actors Leonard Strong and Keye Luke were filming on the set of the movie "Hell's Half Acre", filmed in Honolulu Chinatown when they 
                took this picture of Keye and his relatives.  The second image names the persons in the photo (reversed, it was on the back of the photo).   From Left to Right:  
                Alvin, Keye Luke, A.K. Wong, Alana, Sun Lin Wong, Lavinia and Leonard Strong.  Alvin was only 12 or 13 in this photo!` },
